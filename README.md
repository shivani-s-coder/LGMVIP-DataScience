### Task 1
### Beginner Level
## Name of Project : Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
#### Iris Flowers Classification — This particular Machine learning (ML) project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

#### Iris Dataset — A multivariant dataset used for machine learning purposes. The following dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes sepal length sepal width petal length petal width species In this data set we analyze three species of Iris flower, i-e Iris setosa , Iris versicolor , and Iris verginica.

### Task 2
### Beginner Level
## Name of Project : Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
Trying to predict how the securities exchange will work is one of the most difficult tasks. There are so many variables involved with the expectation – physical elements versus psychological factors, rational and irrational behaviour, and so on. All of these factors combine to make share costs unpredictable and difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.

### Task 3
### Beginner Level
## Name of Project : Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
In Python, an image is just a two-dimensional array of integers. So one can do a couple of matrix manipulations using various python modules in order to get some very interesting effects. In order to convert the normal image to a sketch, we will change its original RGB values and assign its RGB values similar to grey, in this way a sketch of the input image will be generated.

Data - Can take any image for pencil sketch

### Task 4
### Intermediate Level
## Name of Project : Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
Introduction

The Global Terrorism Database -
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

Characteristics of the Database -
It contains information on over 180,000 terrorist attacks Currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks in the world Includes information on more than 88,000 bombings, 19,000 assassinations, and 11,000 kidnappings since 1970 Includes information on at least 45 variables for each case, with more recent incidents including information on more than 120 variables More than 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources were reviewed to collect incident data from 1998 to 2017 alone.
