### Task 1
### Beginner Level
## Name of Project : Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
#### Iris Flowers Classification — This particular Machine learning (ML) project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

#### Iris Dataset — A multivariant dataset used for machine learning purposes. The following dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes sepal length sepal width petal length petal width species In this data set we analyze three species of Iris flower, i-e Iris setosa , Iris versicolor , and Iris verginica.

### Task 2
### Beginner Level
## Name of Project : Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
Trying to predict how the securities exchange will work is one of the most difficult tasks. There are so many variables involved with the expectation – physical elements versus psychological factors, rational and irrational behaviour, and so on. All of these factors combine to make share costs unpredictable and difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.

### Task 3
### Beginner Level
## Name of Project : Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
In Python, an image is just a two-dimensional array of integers. So one can do a couple of matrix manipulations using various python modules in order to get some very interesting effects. In order to convert the normal image to a sketch, we will change its original RGB values and assign its RGB values similar to grey, in this way a sketch of the input image will be generated.

Data - Can take any image for pencil sketch
